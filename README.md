# Hospital-Readmission-Prediction

This repository contains a machine learning model trained on healthcare data to predict hospital readmission. The goal of the model is to predict whether a patient will be readmitted to the hospital within a certain time period after discharge.

The model utilizes multiple machine learning algoriths like Decision Trees, Random Forest, SVM, Gaussian Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, XGBoost, LightGBM to predict the patient will be re-admitted or not.
