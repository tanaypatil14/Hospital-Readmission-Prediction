# Hospital-Readmission-Prediction

This repository contains a machine learning model trained on healthcare data to predict hospital readmission. The goal of the model is to predict whether a patient will be readmitted to the hospital within a certain time period after discharge.

The model utilizes multiple machine learning algoriths like Decision Trees, Random Forest, SVM, Gaussian Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, XGBoost, LightGBM to predict the patient will be re-admitted or not.

All the code is available in the Hospital_Readmission_Prediction.ipynb file


Model performance can be seen in the Model_Performance.png and ROC_Curve_all_models.png


hospital_readmissions.csv is the dataset file


All the Steps, Exploratory Data Analysis and Methodologies are documented in the Tanay_Patil_IPD_Readmission_Prediction_Report.pdf
